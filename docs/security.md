# Security Documentation

## Security Features Overview

This project implements several key security features:

- **Code Scanning**: Regular scans using Trunk for vulnerability detection and code quality
- **Dependency Management**: Uses UV package manager for Python dependencies with lockfile support
- **Secrets Management**: No hard-coded secrets in code or configuration files
- **Development Practices**: 
  - GPG-signed commits for verification
  - Strict branch protection rules
  - Code review requirements

## Security Scanning Results and Mitigations

### Current Scanning Setup

The project uses the following security scanning tools:
- Trunk for code security scanning
- Gitleaks for secrets detection
- UV for Python dependency vulnerability scanning

### Recent Results and Mitigations

The following security measures have been implemented based on scanning results:
- All dependencies are kept up-to-date using UV package manager
- No secrets are stored in code - all sensitive data is managed through environment variables
- Regular dependency updates to patch known vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Configuration
1. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
2. Never commit `.env` files or secrets to version control
3. Use separate environment configurations for development and production

### Access Control
1. Implement principle of least privilege
2. Use role-based access control where applicable
3. Regularly audit access permissions

### Dependency Management
1. Keep all dependencies updated to latest secure versions
2. Use UV lockfile to ensure dependency consistency
3. Regularly run security audits on dependencies

### Monitoring and Logging
1. Implement comprehensive logging
2. Monitor for unusual activity
3. Maintain audit trails for security-relevant events

### Deployment Security
1. Use secure communication channels (HTTPS/SSL)
2. Implement proper firewalls and network security
3. Regular security patches and updates

## Security Issue Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:
1. Do NOT open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the security team at [security contact email]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability

## Regular Security Maintenance

- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly security scanning reviews
- Quarterly security policy reviews
